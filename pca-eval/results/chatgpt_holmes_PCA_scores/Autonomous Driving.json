Follow the vehicle in front of you slowly\n\n[Agent Answer]: Based on the information provided by the APIs, here's the analysis:\n\n1. The `detect_traffic_sign()` API indicates that there are no traffic signs detected, which means there are no specific restrictions or indications for overtaking in the image.\n\n2. The `object_detection()` API detects the presence of 15 cars, 0 people, and 0 bicycles. Considering there are multiple cars in the image, it suggests that overtaking might be possible.\n\n3. The `weather_detection()` API indicates that the current weather is rainy. This information is important as it can affect the road conditions and visibility, making overtaking more challenging and potentially risky.\n\nBased on this analysis, the recommended action for overtaking the vehicle in front of you would be to (B) accelerate through the vehicle gap.

Since you are currently on the main road, there is no need to change to another road or stop.\n\n2. `object_detection()` does not detect any cars, people, or bicycles in the image.

This suggests that you are driving on a main road or a motorway where cars have priority. Therefore, the best action would be to (E) Keep driving and maintain your current speed.\n\nThe `object_detection()` API detected 25 cars, 0 people, and 0 bicycles. This information indicates the presence of multiple cars on the road, supporting the decision to continue driving.\n\nThe `weather_detection()` API indicates that the weather is clear, which further supports the decision to keep driving.\n\nThe `ocr()` API did not detect any text in the image, so we do not have any additional information from that source.\n\nConsidering all the information gathered, the best action would be to keep driving on the road.\n\n[Correct Action]: (A) Slow down\n[Key Concepts]: ['congested road']\n[Reference Reasoning Process]: Based on the image. You are now at main road, so you can keep driving. But there are several cars in front of the car which lead to congested road.
